# Introduction
Hi! I'm Aina Nur Malisa (Malisa), a final year student in the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. 
Iâ€™m a final-year student taking the Framework-Based Software Design and Development course. I'm really looking forward to learning more about how modern software is maintained and how to deal with legacy systems. These are skills I know will be important in real-world development, especially as I get ready to start my career. Iâ€™m hoping to get more hands-on experience with frameworks and better understand how to work with existing codebases.
